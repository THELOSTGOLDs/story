    <h2>Chapter 1: The Spark — My Introduction to Bitcoin</h2>
  </header>

  <p>It all started in the year 2012. I was still very young—full of curiosity, dreams, and an unstoppable hunger to learn new things. My name is Danish Afsar, and I come from a town called Nagpur. Back then, I was the kind of kid who got fascinated by things others didn’t even notice. Tech, gadgets, the internet—it was all magic to me.</p>
  <p>My older brother, whom I'll call SS, was much older than me. He was already into the digital world long before I even understood what a domain name was. He used to build websites and sell digital games to customers overseas. That might sound ordinary now, but back then, in our part of the world, it was extraordinary. Internet entrepreneurship wasn’t common, and SS was already swimming in that pool.</p>
  <p>In our household, we didn’t come from extreme wealth, but my father never let me feel like I lacked anything. Whatever was within his capacity, he gave—without hesitation. I was the only one in our family who had a laptop. Not even SS had one at first. Ironically, though, my friends and even relatives seemed to use it more than I did. It became everyone’s laptop, but I didn’t mind. That’s how I was—open-hearted and trusting.</p>
  <p>It was around this time that SS discovered a new payment method for his overseas transactions: Bitcoin.</p>
  <p>That was my first encounter with it.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin wasn't well-known yet—at least not in India. There weren’t any formal banking systems or international transfer methods available to us at that age. So, when SS found Bitcoin, it was like discovering a hidden door to a secret world. We didn’t fully understand what we had found, but we knew it was something different. Something powerful.</p>
  <p>Back then, whatever earnings we made were considered shared between SS and me. We were like partners—dreaming of a digital future together. But things changed. Over time, SS created his own wallet. Quietly, without telling me, he transferred a part of the Bitcoin into it. I didn’t realize what was happening at first. I was too naive, too trusting.</p>
  <p>Then, the years passed.</p>
  <p>By 2018, we started to hear more about Bitcoin. News headlines, social media posts, YouTube videos—it was suddenly everywhere. And the prices? They were skyrocketing. We went back and checked. Our stash—yes, 356 Bitcoins—was real. It was still there. That number stayed with me, like a tattoo on my memory.</p>
  <p>From 2012 to 2022, life was a wild ride. I always remembered the passphrase to our wallet. I even wrote it down at one point. Everything felt secure, and life felt exciting. We didn’t feel the need to touch the wallet. We just watched. Dreaming of the day we’d unlock our fortune.</p>
  <p>I can’t fully describe the experiences I had during those years. They shaped me—emotionally, mentally, spiritually. That decade gave me everything: hope, purpose, connection—and eventually, heartbreak.</p>
  <p>But I didn’t know that last part yet.</p>
  <p>This was just the beginning....</p>

  </div>

  <p>It was December 21, 2022. I remember the date clearly because I was preparing to shift to Pune—a big move for me, personally and professionally. I was excited, hopeful, and loaded with ambition. But like always, I was in a rush.</p>
  <p>That day, before boarding my bus to Pune, I decided to take a few precautionary steps regarding my Bitcoin. I had 356 BTC, but I wasn’t going to carry all of it mentally or digitally unguarded into a new phase of life. I quickly transferred 2 BTC and 0.74 BTC to someone else—a temporary move, a kind of test, or reason can't be shared. I wanted to protect the majority of the stash.</p>

  <div class="quote">“I had 356 Bitcoins... and I thought I was being safe.”</div>

  <p>But then came the decision that changed everything.</p>
  <p>I decided to change the wallet passphrase.</p>
  <p>I had this idea that since I was going to a new city with a new mindset, I should also refresh my security. It felt smart at the time—secure even. So, I opened my MacBook and downloaded a password generator. Not just any generator, but one that created strong, complex, nearly uncrackable passwords.</p>

  <div class="image">

  </div>

  <p>It generated a string—random, brutal, impossible to memorize. And I watched it. Just eight seconds.</p>
  <p>I was in a hurry. As usual.</p>
  <p>I thought I was being safe. I copied the passphrase and saved it in Apple Notes, thinking it was automatically synced with iCloud. I even locked the note for extra security.</p>

  <div class="quote">“I boarded my bus to Pune, filled with hope, carrying dreams, and unknowingly leaving behind the digital keys to my fortune.”</div>

  <p>And then I left.</p>
  <p>This one move—meant for security—would end up changing everything.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Pune was kind to me in many ways. I had money, freedom, and momentum. From 2022 to early 2025, life felt like it was on autopilot. I wasn’t worried. I had the wallet. I had the passphrase. Or so I thought.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin prices were rising steadily. Every time I saw the charts go up, a part of me smiled. I didn’t need to check the wallet often. I knew it was there. I had secured it. I had saved the key.</p>

  <div class="quote">“That was the lie I lived with.”</div>

  <p>The problem was, I had assumed the password note was saved to iCloud, synced across my devices. But in reality, it had been saved only locally on the MacBook.</p>
  <p>A MacBook that I no longer had access to.</p>
  <p>I didn’t realize this until it was too late. The machine had either crashed, been replaced, or updated. The note was gone. And with it, the passphrase.</p>

  <div class="image">

  </div>

  <p>At first, I thought maybe I had backed it up elsewhere. Maybe I had sent it to myself. Maybe I had written it down somewhere. But nothing turned up. The note was never synced. The password was never recoverable. And I never truly memorized it.</p>

  </div>

  <p>What’s most dangerous in life isn’t what you know is a threat. It’s what you assume is safe.</p>
  <p>I lived in a false sense of security for over two years. I watched my Bitcoin grow in value. I checked the charts, read the news, and felt quietly proud that I had made the right move at the right time.</p>
  <p>But all the while, the vault was locked—and I had thrown away the key.</p>

  <div class="quote">“You imagine that wealth in Bitcoin is 'safe' because it's decentralized, private, and secure. But that same strength becomes your worst enemy when you're the one who locks yourself out.”</div>

  <p>No hackers.</p>
  <p>No scams.</p>
  <p>No betrayal.</p>
  <p>Just me. My own haste. My own assumptions.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It’s hard to describe what that realization felt like. It wasn’t a sudden explosion of panic. It was a slow, creeping chill—like the sinking feeling when you pat your pockets and realize your phone’s gone. Only this time, it was the passphrase to a digital fortune.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It was 2025—the year my father retired.</p>
  <p>He had served his country with discipline and dignity as a government employee. A man of habits, quiet strength, and endless sacrifice. He’d never asked for much. Never wanted luxury. But as his son, I had always dreamed of giving him everything he never asked for.</p>
  <p>So I made a plan.</p>
  <p>A surprise.</p>
  <p>While he was preparing to leave behind the structured world of government service, I was preparing to show him what I had been quietly building for years. A fortune. Not just money—but a legacy.</p>
  <p>I wasn’t just thinking of telling him—I was planning to build a business empire with him. I imagined the moment: his disbelief, the pride in his eyes, the joy of knowing that his son had created something massive, all while keeping it under wraps.</p>
  <p>That day, I sat with my windows and downloaded Bitcoin Core. I was smiling, heart beating with excitement. The full wallet had to sync from the blockchain—a process that took four long days. I waited, checking the progress bar like a child waiting for a rocket to launch.</p>

  </div>

  <p>When it was finally done syncing, I opened the wallet.</p>
  <p>I pasted the address.</p>
  <p>And then it asked me for the passphrase.</p>
  <p>I smiled to myself. "Easy," I thought. I had saved it years ago.</p>
  <p>I opened my Apple Notes…in my phone scrolled… tapped the lock icon…</p>
  <p>And then…</p>
  <p>Nothing.</p>

  </div>

  <p>At that moment, something inside me broke. I couldn’t breathe. I wasn’t panicking in the traditional sense—I was shutting down. My chest tightened. My mind went blank. It was like my soul had tripped and fallen down a black hole.</p>
  <p>I told myself, “It’s a glitch. It’ll come back. Just refresh.”</p>
  <p>I checked iCloud from my phone.</p>
  <p>Then from Safari.</p>
  <p>Then from another MacBook.</p>
  <p>I logged into every Apple account I could remember.</p>
  <p>Nothing.</p>
  <p>It hit me slowly, like a wave that starts small and turns into a tsunami: the password had never synced to iCloud. It was saved locally, and that machine was gone.</p>
  <p>I stared at the empty note.</p>

  <div class="quote">“I tried to make myself faint. Yes, actually faint. I hoped that maybe if I passed out and woke up, this would all be a dream.”</div>

  <p>But I didn’t faint.</p>
  <p>And it wasn’t a dream.</p>
  <p>It was the moment I realized I had locked myself out of 352 Bitcoins—forever.</p>

  <p>I didn’t speak to anyone for days.</p>
  <p>I searched every corner of my digital life.</p>
  <p>Emails. WhatsApp messages. Telegram. Google Drive. External hard drives. SD cards. Physical notebooks. Old phones. USB drives. I checked everything.</p>
  <p>I even opened my small diary, hoping maybe some part of me had jotted down the passphrase in a moment of foresight.</p>
  <p>Nothing.</p>
  <p>I obsessed over what the password could’ve been. I remembered the style—random, auto-generated, no recognizable words. But the exact string? Gone.</p>
  <p>I tried different combinations.</p>
  <p>Tried to feel what the password was. As if my brain would just produce it under pressure.</p>
  <p>But it never came.</p>
  <p>Sleep became a memory. My heart would race randomly at night. I’d wake up sweating, gasping, thinking maybe—just maybe—it came to me in a dream.</p>
  <p>It never did.</p>

  <div class="quote">“Friends didn’t understand. Family thought I was overreacting. They couldn’t understand.”</div>

  <p>They didn’t know what 356 BTC meant—not just in money, but in time, belief, sacrifice.</p>
  <p>I started searching online. I found people who had lost their Bitcoin. Forums. YouTube videos. Hacker channels. Dark web threads.</p>
  <p>I wasn’t alone. But that didn’t comfort me.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I made a decision.</p>
  <p>If I couldn’t remember the password, maybe I could break it.</p>
  <p>So I started studying.</p>
  <p>I dove deep into the world of cybersecurity, hash functions, brute-force cracking, and wallet recovery tools.</p>
  <p>I downloaded tools like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>John the Ripper</li>
    <li>Hashcat</li>
    <li>BTCRecover</li>
    <li>PyWallet</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I bought a custom-built PC just to run cracking software. I learned about GPU power, wordlists, permutations, bruteforce attacks, and rainbow tables.</p>
  <p>I even wrote scripts.</p>
  <p>Every day, my machine would generate passwords—thousands of guesses per second. I sat and watched them, hoping one of them would unlock the gate.</p>

  </div>

  <p>But Bitcoin’s encryption is brutal.</p>
  <p>It’s made to be impossible to crack without the exact key.</p>
  <p>It’s military-grade. Unforgiving.</p>
  <p>One character off, and it’s useless.</p>

  <div class="quote">“It was like owning a house you can see—but never enter. A vault full of treasure with only structure of password. A digital ghost haunting your every thought.”</div>

  <p>And that’s when the despair truly settled in.</p>
  <p>I had the coins.</p>
  <p>I had the wallet.</p>
  <p>But I didn’t have the key.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Once I accepted that I couldn’t crack the passphrase on my own, the next step was obvious—get help.</p>
  <p>But in the crypto world, help is expensive—and often dangerous.</p>
  <p>I started searching online for wallet recovery experts. Forums, Reddit, darknet threads, hacker blogs—hackeerssforum. Dozens of people claimed they could help. Everyone had fancy websites, success stories, flashy graphics, even fake testimonials.</p>
  <p>But there was one thing they all had in common:<br />
    They all asked me to send the wallet file.</p>
  <p>Every time, I hesitated.<br />
    And every time, I backed off.</p>
  <p>Because if someone gets your wallet file, they don’t need you anymore. If they crack it, you never hear from them again.</p>
  <p>Even if you sign an agreement, it's worthless across borders. Crypto is trustless—and so is the world surrounding it.</p>
  <p>And in India? No one even tried. Most people didn’t understand the level of tech required. Some were fake experts. Some were just kids pretending to know.</p>
  <p>I tried more than 30 people.</p>
  <p>Every single one was either a scammer, a middleman, or clueless.</p>
  <p>I wasted a month in this maze of lies.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Just when I was ready to give up…</p>
  <p>A friend of mine—more like an uncle to me—came into the picture. He saw what I was going through. He had connections in the industry, and he started making calls.</p>
  <p>One contact led to another.</p>
  <p>And through that chain, I got introduced to someone named Firoz Multani.</p>
  <p>Firoz wasn’t just a tech guy.</p>
  <p>He was the CEO of a blockchain company called Blockaura. Calm, generous, and deeply knowledgeable, he didn’t overpromise. He didn’t ask for my wallet file. He just asked to talk.</p>
  <p>Alongside him was his partner Nitin, a finance guy with a mind built for tech.</p>
  <p>They spoke to me online, patiently. They listened to my story. They didn’t laugh or doubt. They believed me. They understood the pain and pressure I was under.</p>
  <p>Whatever percentage they discussed (if they succeeded in unlocking the wallet) is something I won't disclose publicly. But I’ll say this:</p>
  <p>They didn’t charge a single rupee upfront.</p>
  <p>In fact, Firoz took care of everything.</p>
  <p>My flight to Dubai, accommodation, food, even local travel—all covered.</p>
  <p>I wasn’t going alone either. I flew to Dubai with my friend/uncle, who stood by me like family.</p>
  <p>And from the moment we landed…</p>
  <p>The real story began.</p>

  <p>Firoz and Nitin weren’t ordinary people trying to figure out tech.</p>
  <p>They were strategists.</p>
  <p>They treated my wallet like a national-level cybersecurity mission. This wasn’t about just entering a password; it was about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineering memory patterns,</li>
    <li>Creating customized brute-force lists,</li>
    <li>Using behavioral psychology to extract forgotten logic,</li>
    <li>Deploying GPU clusters,</li>
    <li>New ways.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Firoz Bhai sat with me always and just asked me a single thing: Is the structure about the password you said correct?</p>
  <p>Firoz, with his deep blockchain background, understood exactly what wallet encryption meant.</p>
  <p>Nitin, with his technical logic and financial sharpness, mapped out strategies that felt like something out of a movie.</p>
  <p>They didn’t promise miracles.</p>
  <p>They promised an honest attempt, a secure process, and full transparency.</p>
  <p>And that’s more than what anyone else in the world had offered me.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 12: Landing in Dubai</h2>
  </header>

  <p>We landed in Dubai with a thousand thoughts in my head—fear, pressure, and hope—all mixing like a storm.</p>
  <p>Our hotel was already booked, thanks to Firoz bhai. He had told me he’d come to pick us up. But when I called him after landing, he was still sleeping—his eyes didn’t open in time, and he told me straight, <q>Bhai, hotel already booked hai, aap seedha chale jao.</q></p>
  <p>No drama. No excuses. Just honesty.</p>
  <p>So we grabbed a taxi from the airport.</p>
  <p>And boom—3,000 INR just like that on the first ride.</p>
  <p>That hit hard.</p>
  <p>I wasn’t carrying a bag full of money. In fact, I had come to Dubai with a very tight budget. Back home, I had responsibilities. My father had just retired, and his pension wouldn’t be coming for at least two to three months.</p>
  <p>I had to watch the house, take care of everything, and still find a way to solve this wallet mess.</p>
  <p>But for now, I was in a different country…</p>
  <p>With very little money…</p>
  <p>And a huge mission.</p>

  <h3>Hotel Check-In &amp; First Meet</h3>
  <p>We reached the hotel in Bur Dubai and checked in.</p>
  <p>Simple, clean, manageable. Exactly what we needed.</p>
  <p>After a while, Firoz bhai and Nitin bhai came to meet us.</p>
  <p>The moment I saw them, all my tension eased up a bit.</p>
  <p>They greeted us warmly—no formality, no ego. Just love.</p>
  <p>We went out together for lunch, talked, shared the full story again, and everything felt genuine. Like they truly understood what I was going through.</p>
  <p>After lunch, I gave him the pendrive.</p>
  <p>Yes—the one holding my wallet file.</p>
  <p>That was the most critical file of my life.</p>
  <p>And handing it over felt like giving someone my soul.</p>
  <p>But I trusted Firoz bhai. I don’t know why.</p>
  <p>Maybe it was his way of talking. Maybe it was the honesty in his eyes.</p>
  <p>I just knew—I had no better option in the world right now.</p>
  <p>They told us to rest, and they left with the pendrive.</p>
  <p>The whole evening, I was in mental pressure.</p>
  <p>Did I do the right thing? What if something goes wrong?</p>
  <p>What if I get scammed before?</p>
  <p>But deep inside, I reminded myself—</p>
  <p class="quote">“This time feels different.”</p>

  <h3>Dinner &amp; Real Hospitality</h3>
  <p>Later that night, Firoz bhai came alone to meet us again.</p>
  <p>He took us for dinner nearby. The place he took us to wasn’t some random restaurant. The owner was his friend, and he personally introduced us.</p>
  <p>He even told the restaurant owner,</p>
  <p><q>These people are my guests. Whatever they need—food, tea, anything—put it on my account.</q></p>
  <p>That line hit differently.</p>
  <p>Not because of the money.</p>
  <p>But because for the first time, I felt like someone actually had my back.</p>
  <p>He stayed with us for a while, made sure we were comfortable, and then left.</p>

  <p>That was Day 1 in Dubai.</p>
  <p>I was in a new country, carrying the weight of 352 BTC, with no certainty of what tomorrow would bring.</p>
  <p>But I had given the file. I had taken the risk.</p>
  <p>And now, the story was moving forward.</p>

  <p>We woke up in the hotel the next morning—Day 2 in Dubai.</p>
  <p>Had our breakfast right there in the hotel. Nothing too fancy, just enough to start the day.</p>
  <p>There was a weird calm in my heart… but also restlessness.</p>
  <p>Like something big was going to happen today. But I didn’t know what.</p>
  <p>We passed some time just casually roaming nearby, talking, and trying to keep the stress out of our minds.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, Firoz bhai called.</p>
  <p>He said, <q>Come to the metro station—Sharaf DG.</q></p>
  <p>We got ready and reached there quickly.</p>
  <p>But then, as usual—Dubai traffic. He called again and said, <q>Bhai I’m stuck… you take a cab and come directly to my apartment. I’ll pay once you reach.</q></p>
  <p>Now the issue was—I hadn’t converted my currency yet.</p>
  <p>I told him.</p>
  <p>He replied casually, like a true brother,</p>
  <p><q>Don’t worry, you come. I’ll handle it.</q></p>

  <h3>Firoz Bhai’s Apartment</h3>
  <p>We reached the apartment.</p>
  <p>As soon as we reached the ground floor, he was already waiting downstairs.</p>
  <p>He welcomed us warmly, no awkwardness, no show-off—just genuine hospitality.</p>
  <p>When we went up to his apartment, I was stunned.</p>
  <p>There was a clear view of Burj Khalifa from his balcony.</p>
  <p>We even took photos in that stressful mode.</p>
  <p>For a second, I forgot why I was in Dubai. I just stood there and took it all in.</p>
  <p>This wasn’t a moment of luxury—it was a moment of pause.</p>
  <p>In all the chaos and tension, this small view gave me a 5-second break from my own mind.</p>

  <h3>The First Attempt – A Missed Shot</h3>
  <p>Then he sat me down and said something I wasn’t expecting:</p>
  <p><q>Bhai, I took the pendrive to the Chinese guys I know. They tried to recover the old wallet file, but they couldn’t. It’s gone.</q></p>
  <p>He was even making fun of that Chinese with Nitin, <q>Abey Nitin isko dikhta bhi hai Kya.</q></p>
  <p>That hit me in the chest.</p>
  <p>Because if that old file had been found, I already knew that password.</p>
  <p>But the reality?</p>
  <p>I had replaced the old file with the new one.</p>
  <p>It was my mistake. I didn’t know how this would all go down.</p>
  <p>I trusted my Mac, I trusted the process. But life doesn’t always work by logic. Sometimes, destiny plays its own game.</p>
  <p>And this time, I was the one who made the wrong move.</p>
  <p>I just sat there quiet for a while.</p>
  <p>Firoz bhai didn’t blame me. He just nodded like a big brother would and said,</p>
  <p><q>Koi baat nahi, now we go with Plan B.</q></p>

  <h3>End of Day 2</h3>
  <p>Later, Nitin bhai came downstairs to meet us.</p>
  <p>They had a short discussion and then dropped us back to the hotel.</p>
  <p>No heavy talks, no false hopes.</p>
  <p>Just silent support. And that meant a lot.</p>
  <p>Day 2 ended with more questions than answers.</p>
  <p>But it also ended with a clearer direction:</p>
  <p>Plan A was gone.</p>
  <p>Plan B begins tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 14: Plan B – The Real Cost</h2>
  </header>

  <p>So now it was time for Plan B.</p>
  <p>The first attempt to recover the old file had failed.</p>
  <p>Now we had to go full-blown tech mode.</p>
  <p>GPUs, high-end machines, custom scripts.</p>
  <p>And to be honest?</p>
  <p>I had no idea what was going on.</p>
  <p>I’m not a technical guy on that level.</p>
  <p>I just knew one thing — this was going to cost a bomb.</p>
  <p>And all of it… was Firoz bhai’s plan.</p>
  <p>He was the one handling the entire load.</p>
  <p>He told me one night,</p>
  <p class="quote">Bhai, ye kaam easy nahi hai. Tere case mein toh 1 crore ka kharcha lag sakta hai.</p>
  <p>That line hit hard.</p>
  <p>And yet—he never pressured me, never demanded anything upfront.</p>
  <p>He was just laying the reality on the table.</p>

  <h3>GPU Hunt &amp; Script Testing</h3>
  <p>Every day became about finding GPUs, negotiating, checking compatibility, and prepping the setup.</p>
  <p>While Firoz bhai was chasing the hardware,</p>
  <p>Nitin bhai was in his own zone—writing, testing, debugging custom scripts.</p>
  <p>Everything was being tailored to my password structure.</p>
  <p>And Firoz bhai?</p>
  <p>He became more than a friend.</p>
  <p>He became an investigator.</p>
  <p>Every few hours he’d call me and ask:</p>
  <p class="quote">Bhai yehi structure tha na?</p>
  <p class="quote">Pakka tu yeh pattern use karta tha na?</p>
  <p class="quote">Confirm na? Kyunki galat hua toh paisa aur time dono barbaad ho jayenge.</p>
  <p>And I respected that.</p>
  <p>Because spending crores on just assumptions is not bravery—it’s stupidity.</p>
  <p>Even I wouldn't allow that.</p>
  <p>But I was damn sure about my structure.</p>
  <p>I had set it myself. I remembered how I created it.</p>
  <p>I may not have the passphrase—but I knew how I think.</p>

  <h3>12 Days of Fire</h3>
  <p>But bro… let me tell you…</p>
  <p>Those 12 days in Dubai felt like 12 years.</p>
  <p>The waiting. The tension. The silence.</p>
  <p>Firoz bhai had said we would start the work from the 29th,</p>
  <p>so until then, it was just preparation, stress, and survival.</p>
  <p>I was going insane.</p>
  <p>No proper sleep. No outings. No distractions.</p>
  <p>Because the more I moved around, the more money I burned.</p>
  <p>Dubai isn’t a city for broke minds.</p>
  <p>And I wasn’t broke in life—I was just broke in that moment.</p>

  <h3>Mentally Breaking</h3>
  <p>I was so stressed, bro…</p>
  <p>I started smoking 25–30 cigarettes a day.</p>
  <p>Plus vaping.</p>
  <p>Even my lungs were tired of asking,</p>
  <p class="quote">Bhai, tu zinda rehna chahta hai ya nahi?</p>
  <p>But I had no answer.</p>
  <p>Because I didn’t know what would happen tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Everything felt so tight.</p>
  <p>I couldn’t even tell my family how much pressure I was in.</p>

  <h3>29th Morning: Another Delay</h3>
  <p>Then, on the morning of 29th,</p>
  <p>Firoz bhai showed up at 4 AM.</p>
  <p>I was half asleep when he said,</p>
  <p class="quote">Bhai, setup hone mein abhi aur 4 din lagenge.</p>
  <p>And honestly, I broke a little inside.</p>
  <p>The money, the stress, the cigarette fumes, the silent hotel room—it was all becoming too much to hold in.</p>
  <p>But I couldn’t leave.</p>
  <p>I had to see this through.</p>

  <p>This was no longer just about Bitcoin.</p>
  <p>This was about me vs fate.</p>
  <p>Me vs my own choices.</p>
  <p>And me vs the system I couldn’t beat alone.</p>
